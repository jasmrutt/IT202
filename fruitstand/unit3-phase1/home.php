        <p>
            Founded in June 1981, the founder Jasmin Rutter wanted to find a way
            to make fruits more accessible to all areas. She started small with her first fruit stand in
            her local area in Boulder, Colorado, which would later grow into a chain of 
            businesses known as Fruit Burst.
            At Fruit Burst, we strive to give everyone the 
            opportunity to buy fresh fruits for reasonable prices. Our goal is to bring joy to 
            people through the employees and fruits customers come in contact with.
            By doing so, people from all across the nation will be able to experience a comfort and pleasure,
            as well as, come together as a community.
